# Visualizing eagles in British Columbia

This simple web app offers an interactive interface where viewers can explore the movement of ten of British Columbia's eagles over a period of 1-2 years. This data was accessed from [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main), where it was originally published by the [Hancock Wildlife Foundation](https://hancockwildlife.org/). The visualization and interactivity is implemented using Mapbox GL JS, d3.js, and turf.js.

Take a look at the visualization [here](https://hannahker.github.io/eagles-movement/) (most optimally viewed in Chrome).
